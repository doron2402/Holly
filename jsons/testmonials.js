    text_full: '"As a former Rockridge Little School teacher, I wanted to share with everyone (in the world!) what an amazing place it is.  When you enter the school, you can immediately feel the magic in the air.  The teachers are a mixture of warmth, creativity, silliness, and drive.  It is because of this combination that the kids are able to learn at the highest level while still getting to be kids!. In the beginning of my time at RLS, Holly told me she believed that the teachers were the heart of the school.  I have worked at other schools with set curriculum and strict molds of how a teacher should be. Holly trusts that her teachers know what is best for their groupâ€™s style of learning.  <br/> RLS is a place where children can imagine, create, learn, play, AND be themselves.  I only wish every preschool child could have the same amazing education as the children at RLS receive!"'

The classroom environment is creative, enriching, and full of warmth and laughter.  We also appreciate how the school imparts values of friendship, generosity, cooperation and community to the children.  We feel fortunate to have found RLS and to be part of the RLS community!"',

    text_full: '"Rockridge Little School has been a wonderful support network for our family. Our daughter has attended for nearly two years and we couldn\'t be happier with the connections she has made with her friends and her incredible teachers. Her experience of creative exploration has transformed her way of relating to the world. Her curiosity and sense of wonder are nurtured and supported every day. The teachers have such a wonderful way of tuning into the children and their unique personalities and temperaments. Our daughter has benefited tremendously from this level of support and care, being that she tends to be more withdrawn in new situations and slow to warm at first. The teachers collectively possess a magical quality and an excitement and joy in all they do. As a result, the children not only feel safe, respected, and nurtured, but they are excited, engaged, and inspired to explore. The parent community has also been a wonderful extension of our RLS experience! The impromptu gatherings at Frog Park as well as regularly planned gatherings give us parents a chance to connect and support one another on our parenthood journeys."',
